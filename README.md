# M8_KitCreator
Simple Sliced audio file creator thats compatible with the M8

The idea here is to be able to take a selection of wav files and mash them into a sliced kit that the M8 likes.

This is a python script with a couple dependencies, but nothing weird.
Right now, it ia putting the file together and adding the markers for the slices, but they're in the wrong spots.
A little work in oceanaudio or something, and you're good. 

Also, hoping to add silence clipping to the script's bag of tricks.
